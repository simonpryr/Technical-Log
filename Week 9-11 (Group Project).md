# Week 9 Technical Log                  
## Group Discussion for the development of a Project Statement    Duration (50 minutes)
All the Group menber gathered and discussed about the project statement. We the member of 
Collaborative peoject used the Collab Project Topic and based on that we discussed and 
created a draft project statement.
## Meeting with the Instructor                                    (Duration: 10 minutes)
Initially we wanted to work with the data that we would get from the client but due to time constrant for the 
data acquisition we have to chane the topic. We received the valuable insight about the project statement
format in detail. We got the guidance to start with.
## Worked on the Project Statement after receiving feedback from the instructor   (Duration: 120 minutes)
We discussed as a team about the topic and figured out some data and came up with the proposal to 
Present multiple natural hazards data (live, temporal, continuous, etc.) with various web platforms effectively using
ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboard, ArcGIS Storymap technology. we are looking for the approval of the project statement
from the Instructor.

We were clearified about that we donot need a server to fetch the live data
but can directly use the data from the ArcGIS Living Atlas.
We were asked to include the Canadian data as well if possible.

# Week 11 Technical Log          
## Studied about the ArcGIS Story Map    (Duration: 60 minutes)
I Stent some time studying about the ArcGIS Story Map from the ESRI Documentation Page.
https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-storymaps/get-started/what-is-arcgis-storymaps.htm
I got insight about the use of ArcGIS Story Map and some elements that could be included like, map, narrative text, images, videos, embedded items, and other media.
I watched a video on Youtube to know the functionality in more profound way, Source:

## Discussion with Instructor      (Duration: 10 minutes)
We got the valuable insights about the data visualization and things we 
could test out in our data.

## Discussion about feedback and listing some things to do    (Duration: 20 minutes)
1. Search live data of Earthquake for US and Canada
2. Research on how to Join Two Feature Layer
3. Research on Convert CSV to Hosted Feature Layer
4. If we are using CSV file figure out a way to auto update the live date (Python Script)
How to Filter data.
